Special for OpenPHACTS 1.3

After loading data as described in README.md

Run the following SQL commands:

CREATE TABLE mappingSetOriginal LIKE mappingSet; 
INSERT mappingSetOriginal SELECT * FROM mappingSet;
UPDATE mappingSet SET justification = "http://semanticscience.org/resource/SIO_000985" where justification = "http://example.com/ConceptWikiGene" and sourceDataSource = "ConceptWiki";
UPDATE mappingSet SET justification = "http://semanticscience.org/resource/SIO_000985" where justification = "http://example.com/ConceptWikiProtein" and sourceDataSource = "ConceptWiki";

Creating the mappingSetOriginal table is optional but highly recommened as allows for recovery.

Optional later when everything works you can do
DELETE table mappingSetOriginal
