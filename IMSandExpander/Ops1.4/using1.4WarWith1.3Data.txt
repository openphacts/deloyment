These instruction should allow you to use the 1.4 QueryExpander.war with older IMS data.

Please back up the old working war before attempting this change to you can revert!

As the IMS1.3 and IMS1.4 have almsot the same API and code the two war files should be interchangeable

The only issue is that the data has changed so older versions of the files DataSource.ttl and graph.properties are required

While the QueryExpander.war includes a copy of these files it will first try to pick up this file in the same way as local.properties is picked up.

So to use the IMS1.4 war with older data.

1. Backup you old war
2. Find the DataSource.ttl and graph.properties files in the folder you found the old war in.
2a. Place it in the same folder as local.properties file
3. Replace 1.3 QueryExpander file with 1.4 QueryExpander file
4. Restart tomcat.

===
Note.
The only API differences between 1.3 and 1.4 are the 

1. QueryExpander/mappingSet now requires sourceCode and targetCode parameters
    -Without these the mothod took several minutes to return
   
2. QueryExpander/SourceInfos and QueryExpander/SourceTargetInfos methods added to replace QueryExpander/mappingSet
    A. html version of QueryExpander/mappingSe will return the data from these methods where suitable

3.  QueryExpander/graphviz method will always throw an exception as it
    A, Depended on mappingSet and so did not scale
    B. Output was useless anyway for so many linksets
