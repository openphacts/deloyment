These instruction should allow you to use the 1.4 QueryExpander.war with older IMS data.

Please back up the old working war before attempting this change to you can revert!

As the IMS1.3 and IMS1.4 have almsot the same API and code the two war files should be interchangeable

The only issue is that the data has changed so older versions of the files DataSource.ttl and graph.properties are required

While the QueryExpander.war includes a copy of these files it will first try to pick up this file in the same way as local.properties is picked up.

So to use the IMS1.4 war with older data.

1. Backup you old war
2. Find the DataSource.ttl and graph.properties files in the folder you found the old war in.
https://github.com/openphacts/deployment/blob/master/IMSandExpander/Ops1.3.1/DataSource.ttl
https://github.com/openphacts/deployment/blob/master/IMSandExpander/Ops1.3.1/graph.properties

2a. Place it in the same folder as local.properties file
3. Replace 1.3 QueryExpander file with 1.4 QueryExpander file
https://github.com/openphacts/deployment/blob/master/IMSandExpander/Ops1.4.0.1/QueryExpander.war

4. Restart tomcat.

===
Note.
The only API differences between 1.3 and 1.4 are the 

1. QueryExpander/mappingSet now requires sourceCode and targetCode parameters
    -Without these the mothod took several minutes to return
   
2. QueryExpander/SourceInfos and QueryExpander/SourceTargetInfos methods added to replace QueryExpander/mappingSet
    A. html version of QueryExpander/mappingSe will return the data from these methods where suitable

3.  QueryExpander/graphviz method will always throw an exception as it
    A, Depended on mappingSet and so did not scale
    B. Output was useless anyway for so many linksets

Debuging
If placing the 1.4 war on the 1.3 data goes wrong the most likely cause is not finding the DataSource.ttl or graph.properties files

Check the log files for something like
2014-04-23 15:02:23,208  INFO org.bridgedb.utils.Reporter - Looking for local.properties
2014-04-23 15:02:23,208  INFO org.bridgedb.utils.Reporter - Unable to find C:\Tomcat 7.0\local.properties in local Directory

2014-04-23 15:02:23,209  INFO org.bridgedb.utils.Reporter - Loaded file local.properties from C:\Tomcat 7.0\conf\BridgeDb\local.properties

The DataSource.ttl should be in the same place as it says it read local.properties from

Chek the logs for 
2014-04-23 15:02:23,877  INFO org.bridgedb.utils.Reporter - Looking for DataSource.ttl
And you should NOT see something like.
2014-04-23 15:02:23,938  INFO org.bridgedb.utils.Reporter - Loaded DataSource.ttl from .... with class loader.
