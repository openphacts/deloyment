#This is an example rdfConfig.txt file with the default values in it.
#To set your own file copy this file for example to $CATALINA_HOME/conf/OPS-IMS and edit it there.
#Ideally point Environment variable OPS-IMS-CONFIG to the folder containing your config files.

#BaseURI should match the localing the war will be propped to or links will not work.
BaseURI                 http://localhost:8080/OPS-IMS/

#WARNING leaving the default relative links is not recommeneded!
#Relative links will fail if loading and running is not done from the same directory.
#Remember that these directies (in the defaults ../rdf/linksets and ../rdf/testLinksets) MUST exist, 
#Remember to grant READ and WRITE ACCESS to all users running any BridgeDB programs including tomcat.

#Main RDF store
SailNativeStore         ../rdf/linksets

#Load RDF Store
#This give the option of having a seperate load database to reload all data while he service stays live.
#Note: You will have to stop start the service (or drop in a new war) after swapping load and production servers
LoadSailNativeStore     ../rdf/linksets
#Defaults to SailNativeStore if not set

#Test and temporary RDF store
#This folder MUST exist as for non admins to save data in and is therefor used in validation.
#WARNING do not set the test store to be the same as the production store as many of the tests erases the store!
#the default relative directory will use the RDF directory directly below $BridgeDB
TestSailNativeStore     ../rdf/testLinksets

#Warning you will also need a sqlConfig.txt file
